I build emotional attachment with her bit by bit during the past two years.

<p>Rootlessness is a terrifying term to even just think about for one second. Whenever it puzzles me I barely manage to comfort myself that at least I belong to Chongqing, a city where I was born and raise up, of prominent personalities that flow in my blood and I feel proud of.</p>
<p>I wrote an <a href="https://nomadland-sl.github.io/posts/identity/">essay</a> about identity and hometown last year. I can still recall that was an improvisational piece when I was stuck in an emotional spiral.
